  curseText:
  - Bosses have their minds set on getting that for the company.
  - Yeah, it'll surely skyrocket their careers.
  - Upper management will be ecstatic.
  - They've been looking for an upper edge for decades now.
  - "And if this works out\u2026"
  - "...and someone can extract it finally\u2026"
  - '...then they''ll be the fucking employee of the decade!'
  - Karen has a plan how to do it.
  - "I heard she has had\u2026"
  - '...hushed meetings with Rex lately.'
  - But HR is breathing down on them though.
  - They are looking for any mistake in the plan, to shut it down.
  - If it gets too risky, then yeah, that'd be best.
  - "I don't want to end up on the street\u2026"
  - '...if the police shuts this place down for good.'
  - Although no local police can really shut down the whole thing.
  - This shit is like Illuminati!
  - "It will just go on somewhere else\u2026"
  - '... until they get a new foothold in here.'
  - But I can't take that risk.
  - Little low-levels like me could end up behind bars.
  - And that's just bullshit!
  - I know too much already, I never wanted to know.
  - I heard Karen say she found a potential source.
  - "And Rex, he was\u2026 smiling the other day."
  - So they must be really onto something.
  - "Maybe I should just tell HR what I know\u2026"
  - '... before things get too hot.'
  - "Although if I leave them be and they succeed\u2026"
  - '... something good could trickle down as well.'
  - Rewards could be amazing!
  - But at what cost?
  - "When I went to the office basement\u2026"
  - '...I swear I heard screams in there.'
  - Sure, it could have been something else!
  - Any noise can be distorted within those echoes.
  - Sure it was just a car screeching off.
  - "But it.. did sound like a scream\u2026"
  - '...that cut off, abruptly.'
  - "Upper management have been after souls\u2026"
  - '... they''re obsessed with them.'
  - Souls are immortal...
  - '...if you want to believe in shit like that.'
  - And management sure does.
  - "Souls trapped in jars, sounds\u2026 icky."
  - Karen got too involved with nursing homes.
  - They got too suspicious.
  - "I have my own suspicions\u2026"
  - '...on where she now gets her subjects.'
  - Rex doesn't care where they come from.
  - That fellow sure is result-oriented.
  - That could get him far in the company.
  - Management really does like results.
  - "But if people keep disappearing\u2026"
  - '...someone will get a sniff of what''s going on.'
  - Karen is too ambitious.
  - She'll get reckless.
  - She'll make a mistake.
  - HR will jump on her
  - "Karen is also the kind of person\u2026"
  - '...who''ll throw anyone under the bus.'
  - If it'll help her survive.
  - I really don't like buses.
  - Especially getting run over by them.
  - I can't help but picture it in my head.
  - Would she try to get my soul as well?
  - "I'm out there, bleeding out\u2026"
  - She, leaning over me, looking in my eyes.
  - Rex, impatiently waiting for my last breath.
  - And floating upwards, but being cut off.
  - Being janked into a container.
  - Being trapped, for all eternity.
  - "As they surely wouldn't\u2026"
  - '...insert my lowly soul into any new body.'
  - Those are reserved for high-ups.
  - "Management might want eternity\u2026"
  - '...but I''m quite content with my lifespan.'
  - Karen seemed quite impatient.
  - When I left the office.
  - "She looked like she was going to\u2026"
  - '... bite the head off anyone distracting her.'
  - She kept looking at the clock.
  - Just waiting for others to leave.
  - Poor Maddy, who had the evening shift.
  - "She's going to be right there\u2026"
  - '...in the middle of it.'
  - When shit hits the fan.
  - "Karen needs to hurry if\u2026"
  - '...she want to get it done tonight.'
  - Robby, from HR, has contacts at the police.
  - "And saving the company from bad rep\u2026"
  - '...that would boost his career.'
  - Rob just needs that last bit of evidence against them.
  - And an access card to the basement.
  - "That's why he's been hitting on\u2026"
  - '...that new chick at the office.'
  - Merry's so infatuated with him.
  - She'd do anything.
  - "Like hand over an exclusive card\u2026"
  - "...simply because he says that he\u2026"
  - '...left his own at his desk, or something.'
  - "And he really need a card to get\u2026"
  - '...coffee from the cafeteria for the two of them.'
  - She'd fall for shit like that in an instant.
  - And there! Rob has his access.
  - "He smiles at Merry\u2026"
  - '...who thinks she has a shot with him.'
  - And Rob heads downstairs.
  - Not to the cafe of course.
  - But to the garage.
  - To the basement.
  - "The card makes a peculiar pling\u2026"
  - '...when it opens the lock.'
  - And Rex'll be there.
  - Probably covered in blood.
  - "And something in his hand\u2026"
  - '...that can be used as a weapon.'
  - I hope Rob has good reflexes.
  - And thenagain, I don't.
  - No witness, no worries.
  - But Rob's no fool, he's prepared.
  - "He has a cell in his hand\u2026"
  - '...ready to press the call.'
  - "If he is as smart as he seems\u2026"
  - '...he''d have called the cops even before that.'
  - So that they are close by, just waiting for the call.
  - Any way this goes, it's going to be ugly.
  - Glad I'm not there to see it.
